# MOS 6502

This is my C++ implementation of the 6502 Microprocessor, accuretly W65C02S which is a modern version of 6502. This implemention is reusable in varity of things one of them could be in NES Emulation and much more. The example shows how acuurate it is to the real world 6502 and its potential what it can do. The code is well written and commented it mentions work of each variable and Function.

# Build Example

- To compile

```
make
```

- To run

```

```

- To delete compiled binary

```
make clean
```
